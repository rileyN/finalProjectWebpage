Thank you for your interest in this project! Please refer to the following sections on how to contribute code and bug reports.

\subsubsection*{Reporting bugs}

At the moment, this project is run in the spare time of a single person (\href{http://rgl.epfl.ch/people/wjakob}{\texttt{ Wenzel Jakob}}) with very limited resources for issue tracker tickets. Thus, before submitting a question or bug report, please take a moment of your time and ensure that your issue isn\textquotesingle{}t already discussed in the project documentation provided at \href{http://pybind11.readthedocs.org/en/latest}{\texttt{ http\+://pybind11.\+readthedocs.\+org/en/latest}}.

Assuming that you have identified a previously unknown problem or an important question, it\textquotesingle{}s essential that you submit a self-\/contained and minimal piece of code that reproduces the problem. In other words\+: no external dependencies, isolate the \mbox{\hyperlink{classfunction}{function(s)}} that cause breakage, submit matched and complete C++ and Python snippets that can be easily compiled and run on my end.

\subsection*{Pull requests}

Contributions are submitted, reviewed, and accepted using Github pull requests. Please refer to \href{https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests}{\texttt{ this article}} for details and adhere to the following rules to make the process as smooth as possible\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Make a new branch for every feature you\textquotesingle{}re working on.
\item Make small and clean pull requests that are easy to review but make sure they do add value by themselves.
\item Add tests for any new functionality and run the test suite ({\ttfamily make pytest}) to ensure that no existing features break.
\item Please run {\ttfamily flake8} and {\ttfamily tools/check-\/style.\+sh} to check your code matches the project style. (Note that {\ttfamily check-\/style.\+sh} requires {\ttfamily gawk}.)
\item This project has a strong focus on providing general solutions using a minimal amount of code, thus small pull requests are greatly preferred.
\end{DoxyItemize}
